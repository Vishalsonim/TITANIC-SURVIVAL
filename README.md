# TITANIC-SURVIVAL
The model predicts whether a passenger would survive on the titanic taking into account and comparing and finding relations amongst various features
LIBRARIES USED- NumPy, pandas,matplotlib, seaborn,sklearn.
CALCULATING/PREDICTING PROBABILITY OF SURVIVAL OF PASSENGERS OF TITANIC WITH RESPECT TO VARIOUS PARAMETRS.
THROUGH DATA CLEANING METHOD AND DATA ANALYTICS-MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MACHINE LEARNING
MAKES DATA SUITABLE FOR APPLYING INTO MACHINE LEARNING MODEL.
FITTING SUITABLE MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHM TO PREDICT HIGHEST ACCURACY.
